由于目前暂时使用RM官方赠车来测试，故缺少陀螺仪模块，通过网络搜素，一款高精度的单轴陀螺仪往往需要几千块的RMB，由于经费紧缺，故优先选择性价比高的单轴陀螺仪模块。通过搜索，查找，最终锁定了一款ADI高精度单轴陀螺仪，其售价低于千元，性能据称可以达到10分钟低于2度的变化。
通过实测，获取/odom topic 的信息可以统计，…分钟…度的变化，精度足以满足比赛要求。

## 1.2.2 camera

Based on our previous experiences, it is highly important to choose a camera that can reduce motion blur. In addition, the parameter adjustment is also one of the necessary functions, which represents the convenience. 
Compare and contrast with previous experience, monocular camera, binocular camera these two cameras are included in our consideration.
For monocular camera,

For binocular camera, the two most important factors we consider are depth sensing and motion tracking. The binocular camera can easily detect the distance between the enemy robot, and then shoot. As a matter of fact, we consider using binocular camera Intel RealSense after the basic implementation of monocular camera:

As mentioned above we finally chose a camera that supports USB3.0, parameters adjustment and high frame rate for motion blur reduction. The resolution of the camera is not that satisfactory, with only 640x360 resolution rate, but the competition does not require the resolution rate that much. It is quite enough to get image features such as amour light bar on this resolution rate. In short, the camera we have chosen is quite enough for the competition.

## 1.2.3 laser

LiDAR is a critical device for localization and navigation.
Since the LiDAR works like shine a small light at a surface and measure the time it takes to return to its source, Therefore the adaptive scanning frequency and range sample frequency would be the high priorities for choosing a LiDAR.
The LiDAR we are going to use is the G4 LiDAR which developed by YDLiDAR CO, with range sample frequency about 9000hz, scanning range around 16m and maximum 12Hz adaptive scanning frequency. The reason why we are choosing this LiDAR is that it has the highest adaptive scanning frequency and range sample frequency among the same type of product, and the price is also quite reasonable.
